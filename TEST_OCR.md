# Testing Real OCR Image Analysis

## How to Test the Real Tesseract.js OCR

The unWalleted system now uses **real OCR** to extract text from images and analyze them for relevant hashtags and keywords. **Tasks will only be completed if relevant keywords/hashtags are found in the image.**

### Test Steps

1. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Backend: http://localhost:3001
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000

2. **Sign In with Magic.link**
   - Enter your email address
   - Check your email for the magic link
   - Click the link to authenticate

3. **Upload an Image with Text**
   - Go to any task on the Dashboard
   - Click "Complete Task"
   - Upload an image that contains text with hashtags like:
     - `#unWalleted`
     - `#taskrewards`
     - `#flowblockchain`
     - `#web3`

4. **Watch the OCR Process**
   - Check the server console for OCR progress:
     ```
     Starting OCR text extraction with Tesseract.js...
     OCR Progress: loading tesseract core 0.1
     OCR Progress: loading language traineddata 0.5
     OCR Progress: initializing tesseract 0.8
     OCR Progress: recognizing text 0.9
     OCR Extraction completed. Text found: Just completed my daily task...
     ```

5. **View Analysis Results**
   - **If validation passes**: The system will show detailed analysis in toast notifications:
     ```
     ‚úÖ Confidence: 80%
     üìù Found Hashtags: #unWalleted, #taskrewards, #flowblockchain
     üîç Found Keywords: unwalleted, taskrewards, flowblockchain
     üìÑ Extracted Text: "Just completed my daily task on unWalleted! #unWalleted #taskrewards #flowblockchain..."
     ```
   
   - **If validation fails**: The system will show why the task was rejected:
     ```
     ‚ùå Task Rejected - Analysis Results:
     üìä Confidence: 5%
     üìù Found Hashtags: None
     üîç Found Keywords: None
     üìÑ Extracted Text: "Random text without relevant content..."
     
     üí° Tip: Include hashtags like #unWalleted, #taskrewards, or keywords like "unwalleted", "web3", "blockchain" in your image.
     ```

### Validation Requirements

**Tasks will only be completed if:**
1. **Relevant hashtags are found** (60% weight): `#unWalleted`, `#taskrewards`, `#flowblockchain`, etc.
2. **OR relevant keywords are found** (20% weight): `unwalleted`, `web3`, `blockchain`, etc.
3. **AND confidence is above 20%**

**Tasks will be rejected if:**
- No relevant hashtags or keywords are found
- Confidence is below 20%
- Image contains no readable text

### Sample Test Images

#### ‚úÖ Good Example (Will Complete)
```
Just completed my daily task on unWalleted! 
#unWalleted #taskrewards #flowblockchain
```

#### ‚úÖ Good Example (Will Complete)
```
Great project! Loving the Magic.link integration 
#unwallet #web3 #blockchain
```

#### ‚ùå Poor Example (Will Be Rejected)
```
Random text without relevant hashtags
```

#### ‚ùå Poor Example (Will Be Rejected)
```
Shubham Kumar - Student of Nagpur University
ICP HUB India is the official regional hub
```

### What the System Detects

#### Hashtags (60% weight)
- `#unWalleted`
- `#unwallet`
- `#taskrewards`
- `#flowblockchain`
- `#magiclink`
- `#web3`
- `#blockchain`
- `#crypto`
- `#tokens`
- `#dapps`
- `#onflow`

#### Keywords (20% weight)
- `unwalleted`
- `unwallet`
- `taskrewards`
- `flowblockchain`
- `magiclink`
- `web3`
- `blockchain`
- `crypto`
- `tokens`
- `dapps`
- `onflow`

#### Recency Indicators (20% weight)
- `today`
- `yesterday`
- `now`
- `just`
- `recent`
- `latest`
- `new`

### Expected Results

| Image Content | Confidence | Result | Message |
|---------------|------------|--------|---------|
| Hashtags + Recent | 80-100% | ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** | Great! Found relevant hashtags and recent content |
| Hashtags Only | 60-80% | ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** | Found hashtags but content may not be recent |
| Keywords Only | 20-40% | ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** | Found relevant keywords |
| Recent Only | 20-40% | ‚ùå **REJECTED** | Content appears recent but missing hashtags |
| No Relevant Content | 0-20% | ‚ùå **REJECTED** | No relevant hashtags or recent content found |

### Performance Notes

- **Processing Time**: 2-5 seconds depending on image complexity
- **Image Quality**: Clear, high-resolution images work best
- **Text Contrast**: Dark text on light background is most readable
- **File Size**: Limited to 50MB for upload

### Troubleshooting

If OCR fails:
1. Check image quality and text clarity
2. Ensure text has good contrast
3. Try a different image format (PNG, JPG)
4. Check server console for error messages

### Real vs. Simulation

**Before (Simulation)**:
- Always returned random sample text
- No actual image analysis
- Instant response (fake)
- Always completed tasks

**Now (Real OCR)**:
- Actually extracts text from images
- Real processing time (2-5 seconds)
- Accurate text detection
- Progress logging in console
- **Strict validation**: Only completes if relevant content is found
